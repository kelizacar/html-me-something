      <p> Kaara Tenshi, who when not writing goes by the name Kelley Carpenter, got her start writing when her aunt purchased her a paw print notebook.
        With that, she began practicing her craft by hand. Her first truly terrible stories included pirate themes and truly terrible plot buildup. </p>
      <p> At the age of 23 Tenshi picked up the pen name Kaara Tenshi when she published her first online webcomic, <a href="thefineprintcomic.com"><em>Fine Print</em>. </a>
        The comic has enjoyed moderate popularlity and is now well into Volume X. Tenshi has reported that she and her artist, Aza Minako, are on track to begin another
        comic, which will be updated concurrently, in late 2017.</p>
       <p> Tenshi, a native Rhode Islander, still lives in the state with her three precious dogs. She spends her free time writing, agonizing over how terrible her drawing
         skills are, and unapologetically obsessing over webcomics.
